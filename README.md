code assessment 
tasks:

Task 1: Write a Three.js script that creates a scene with a rotating cube. The cube should rotate continuously on both the x and y axes.
Task 2: Write custom vertex and fragment shaders using ShaderMaterial to create a simple wave effect on a plane geometry.
Task 3: Create a Threejs line drawing tool.  Add pointer controls to create a line. The line should start on mousedown and be drawn as the mouse moves.  Additionally, a box should be drawn at the line midpoint.  All of this should update as the mouse is being dragged. There is no need to move the line after it is created.
